# OliviaSmith-Portfolio
Hello, my name is Olivia Smith. My recent carrer goals have been to study and learn about technology. With my past educational experiencess it has taken awhile to understand and choose the best subject for me. With the IT world it is something completely new to me and I love being able to learn new things. 
Studying this subject has taken most of my time and has made me very busy. My current project in progess is to continue my educational journey and keeping my focus.
